Tools Used:
-----------
- Python 3.10
- pandas
- time module

External Resources Used:
------------------------
- Udacity project instructions and template
- pandas official documentation:
  https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/
- Python documentation (datetime, string methods):
  https://docs.python.org/3/
- Stack Overflow (for troubleshooting input handling and `.mode()`):

How to Run:
-----------
1. Make sure the files `bikeshare.py`, `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, and `washington.csv` are in the same folder.
2. Run the script from terminal:
   python bikeshare.py
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to explore the data.
4. Type "exit" at any prompt to quit.
